    <string name="content_infor_0">Blood glucose, also known as blood sugar, is the primary sugar present in your bloodstream, serving as the main source of energy for your body. It originates from the foods you consume, as most of the food you eat is broken down into glucose and released into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose levels rise, it triggers your pancreas to release insulin, a hormone responsible for facilitating the entry of glucose into your cells, where it is utilized for energy.</string>
    <string name="content_infor_1">If you have diabetes, it\'s important to monitor your blood glucose regularly to ensure it stays within your target range. Depending on your specific situation, your healthcare team may advise you to check your blood glucose levels daily or even multiple times per day. \n\nThe most common method for checking blood glucose at home is by using a blood glucose meter, which measures the glucose level in a small blood sample, typically obtained from your fingertip. \n\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another option, where a small sensor is placed under your skin to continuously measure glucose levels throughout the day and night. CGM is particularly beneficial for individuals who use insulin and are at risk of low blood glucose levels. \n\nAdditionally, your healthcare provider will conduct periodic blood tests called A1C tests to assess your average blood glucose levels over the past few months. People with diabetes usually undergo an A1C test at least twice a year, although more frequent testing may be necessary if treatment goals aren\'t being met.</string>
    <string name="content_infor_2">High blood glucose, or hyperglycemia, manifests through symptoms like increased thirst, fatigue, headaches, frequent urination, and blurred vision. \n\nIf you experience these symptoms regularly, discussing with your healthcare team is advisable. They may suggest adjustments to your diabetes management, such as changes in your meal plan, physical activity routine, or medication. \n\nAdditionally, high blood glucose can result from other conditions affecting insulin or glucose levels, such as issues with the pancreas or adrenal glands.</string>
    <string name="content_infor_3">Hypoglycemia is prevalent among individuals with diabetes, particularly those who rely on insulin for management. \n\nResearch indicates that approximately 80% of people with Type 1 diabetes and nearly half of those with Type 2 diabetes who use insulin encounter at least one episode of low blood sugar within a four-week timeframe. Moreover, individuals with Type 2 diabetes who take oral medications like meglitinide or sulfonylurea also face an elevated risk of hypoglycemia. \n\nAlthough it\'s rare, hypoglycemia can occur in individuals without diabetes.</string>
    <string name="content_infor_4">If your healthcare provider suspects hypoglycemia, they may conduct frequent blood sugar checks over several days of fasting to assess the condition. Additional tests may be required to identify the underlying cause of hypoglycemia, such as imaging studies to detect any tumors that may be responsible for the low blood sugar episodes.  For reactive hypoglycemia, a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) may be recommended. During this test, you will consume a special drink containing protein, fats, and sugar to stimulate blood glucose production and insulin release. Subsequently, your blood glucose levels will be monitored multiple times over a period of five hours to evaluate your body\'s response.</string>
    <string name="content_infor_5">Preventing low blood sugar episodes in diabetes management can be challenging, but adjustments to your treatment plan can help minimize their occurrence. Understanding the triggers for low blood sugar is crucial, and providing detailed information to your healthcare provider about any episodes you experience is essential for effective management. \n\nTo prevent low blood sugar: \n\n- Adhere to your medication regimen as prescribed. \n\n- Follow your healthcare provider\'s recommendations regarding diet and exercise. \n\n- Utilize continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or regularly check your blood sugar levels, including before and after meals, exercise, and bedtime. \n\n- After treating a low blood sugar episode, document the details, including timing, recent food intake, exercise, symptoms experienced, and blood glucose level. This information can assist you and your provider in adjusting your management plan to prevent future occurrences.</string>
